## Overview

> This library is part of the [Bandi](https://github.com/Bandi-Events) group of projects. These are meant to encourage and incentivize users to enter into the [Web Monetization](https://webmonetization.org/) ecosystem. These projects provide a set of tools to help easily bootstrap a rewards framework for a website or application.

Bandi-Events sets up listeners to monitor [transaction events](https://webmonetization.org/docs/api/#monetizationprogress). You can set a custom multiplier to reward users with points based on their contributions. Take the following example:

- User has 0 points
- Creator has set a multiplier of 100x
- User streams 0.01 to creator
- Bandi-Events captures transaction event and uses multiplier to determine points accrued: `0.01 * 100 = 1 point`
- User balance is updated to 1 and the new balance is returned through callback

Bandi will always be unopinionated about how you use & manage points, and will stay decoupled from any specific systems implementation. It's simply a set of tools intended to help creators bootstrap a rewards system for their applications.

## Requirements

Check out the official Web Monetization [Quick Start Guide](https://webmonetization.org/docs/getting-started) to learn how to set up a wallet for receiving payments. This library assumes you have a meta tag to set up monetization with the payment pointer to your wallet. Example:

```js
<meta
  name="monetization"
  content="$wallet.example.com/alice"
>
```

## Installation

```js
npm install bandi-events --save

or

yarn add bandi-events
```

## Example

```js
const events = new BandiEvents();

events.init({
  currentBalance: 0,
  multiplier: 1000,
  onTransaction: (tx) => console.log(tx),
});
```
